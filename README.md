# Dear Team,

I wanted to provide an explanation for not uploading the Google OAuth Client ID secret in the Static/config/passport-google-oauth2-strategy.js file.

Due to the sensitive nature of the Google OAuth Client ID secret, it is crucial to maintain its confidentiality to prevent unauthorized access and potential security breaches. Uploading this sensitive credential in the project files could expose it to unintended parties, which would compromise the security of our application.

To ensure the security and integrity of our project, I have decided to keep the Google OAuth Client ID secret confidential and not include it in the publicly accessible files. Instead, I suggest using environment variables or a secure configuration management system to handle such sensitive information.

Thank you for your understanding.

Best regards, Shoumodip Das
